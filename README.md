# Hi there

I'm that one person who founded maelink, the open source social media for all.
###### You should totally check it out by the way... https://github.com/maelink-communications

...but I also made some other little projects of my own. Some of these are really old Scratch projects I uploaded to GitHub for archival purposes, some are random JS projects and then there's maelink, the one project I'm actually proud of, somewhat.

So yeah. That's pretty much all there is to this place. Go scavenge around my projects, or don't. :p
